Online Store with Retrofit,RecyclerView,TabLayout,...



I just decided to Create an Android app for my friend's website (https://atandorosti.ir/)

which is a store website. 
I made it simple and basic with my basic knowledge, but I did not continue to do it anymore,

and I decided to go through this project with a new design with Kotlin language. 

So I published it on the github. In this project, as far as I was able to 
customize and use less of a project outside of Google.
Also, I used retrofit for communication, and from RecyclerView and ... 

and Material Design. Hope you can use it. Good luck
